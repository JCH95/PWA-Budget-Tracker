# Budget Tracker Application

  This app is a budget tracker that will allow the user to either add money or subtract money to the tracker.
The user may also title each transaction to better organize their purchases and deposits. Once the user 
titles and adds the transaction to the total, a chart appears, showing the progress of each transaction in
reference to the total amount added at the start. This app will also work offline! Through the use of
IndexedDB, the user may add and subtract transactions from the account at will, even with no service!
